I am a creative person with an unwavering passion for artificial intelligence and deep learning. For nearly five years, I have been deeply immersed in this field, continuously seeking to expand my knowledge and skills. During my master's study, I took a deep dive into AI and joined the Natural Language Processing Lab at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. There, I focused on applying explainable AI methods to natural language processing, which provided me with invaluable experience. After completing my studies, my enthusiasm for the field led me to explore explainability in image processing, and I am currently engaged in an industrial project in this area. I am excited about the opportunity to further enhance my expertise and contribute to achieving impactful goals within a strong and dynamic team.
